To report a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

- **In Scope:** Any security vulnerabilities discovered within the Thalia project itself, including its codebase, dependencies, and infrastructure.
- **Out of Scope:** Security issues related to third-party services, websites, or applications not directly maintained by Thalia. 🚫
